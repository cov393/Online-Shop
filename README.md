# Online Shop

The idea of the application is to create an online store selling vintage and handicrafts. Each user can create an account and list their items for sale. Each user can go to the store and view the list of products in order to buy later.
Important features were created for the security of customers as an authentication method, which used the FireBase Database, which securely stored hashed passwords and a separate list of their items for sale and purchases.
